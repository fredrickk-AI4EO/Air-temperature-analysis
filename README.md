# Air Temperature Analysis

This is my analysis of air temperature data using xarray. I explored spatial patterns, seasonal averages, and added a trend line to the time series.

## What's in here
- `code/air_temperature.ipynb`: The main notebook with plots
- `scripts/xarray_analysis.py`: Extra scripts
- `figures/`: Saved plots
- `requirements.txt`: Libraries needed

## How to use
Install stuff with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the notebook.

## Cool stuff I found
Temperatures vary by season, and there's a slight upward trend over time.
