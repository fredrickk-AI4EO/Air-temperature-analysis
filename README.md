# Air-temperature-analysis

This project analyzes air temperature data from the xarray tutorial dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis, spatial and temporal visualizations, and trend analysis.

## Structure
- `code/`: Jupyter notebook with the analysis
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for additional processing
- `figures/`: Generated plots and visualizations
- `data/`: Data files (if any)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook in `code/` or scripts in `scripts/`

## Results
Key findings include seasonal temperature patterns and a linear trend in the time series.
